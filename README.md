## 🚀 Features

- 📂 Read book data from a file
- 🔍 Case-insensitive search by title and author
- 📊 Sort books by title, author, or publication year
- 🧭 Menu-driven command-line interface
- 📝 Log user interactions
- 💾 Save and restore library state using serialization

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- File I/O
- Bubble Sort Algorithm
- Serialization & Deserialization
- Logging
